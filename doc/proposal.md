## Project Proposal

#### Title: SplitData


#### Summary: 
Our project SplitData is an app allows users to build and share workout schedules. Users will create workout plans that fit their schedule, develop their desired athletic skill sets, and share their creations with other users. 

The application will take in data about certain gym exercises and help the user create a plan that the user can follow to achieve those goals. The user will be able to use those exercises in the components of their workout plans; then, they and other users will be able to reuse the components they create.

#### Usefulness:
Many of us experience a plateau in our fitness journey, often due to repetitive routines and uncertainty about how to challenge ourselves effectively. Our app aims to elevate the workouts of recreational gym-goers by providing personalized training plans that adapt to each user's progress. By setting tailored goals and benchmarks, the app encourages users to continually push their limits and enhance their performance. With insights and recommendations that evolve alongside their fitness journey, users can break through barriers, discover new strengths, and achieve their desired results with confidence. 


#### Realness (datasets):

"The megaGymDataset.csv table contains information on 2918 gym exercises, including titles, descriptions, types, body parts targeted, equipment needed, difficulty levels, ratings, and rating descriptions. This dataset can be used to analyze popular exercises, create personalized workout plans, and assess the effectiveness of different types of workouts"

60 sports ranked across 10 skill categories by ESPN panel to determine what skillsets are prioritized by each sport. (strength, flexibility, endurance, coordination, etc.)

#### Functionality: 
- Basic user operations
- Users may create plans and subcomponents to put in them (sessions, sets) with exercises, and share them with others
- Other users can reuse sessions and sets in their own plans
- **Creative Component:** we will create a heuristic model that allows us to suggest plans, sessions, and sets to users at various phases in their interaction with our website (for example, when browsing plans to try out, recommend plans, but when building plans, recccomend sessions and sets).


#### Mockup:

#### Workflow:
We will all work on the UI/UX for the first 3 week
	Muscle Visualization component: Sana, Kaz
User Quiz component: Sona, Nathan
For the middle part of the semester:
	We will split up and work on the backend
The end of the semester:
	We will focus on improving both our front and backend
