### **Users**
- Each user has a unique `user_id`.
- A single user can create multiple workout plans at different times or for different purposes.
- The **User** is modeled as a separate entity because it does not depend on other entities.

---

### **WorkoutPlan**
- Each workout plan is uniquely created by one user (referenced by `user_id` as a foreign key).
- The `plan_id` is assumed to be unique.
- Each workout plan consists of multiple workout sessions, indexed by the day they are completed.
- The **WorkoutPlan** is a separate entity because each user can have multiple workout plans.

---

### **WorkoutSession**
- Each workout session has a unique `session_id` and is linked to only one workout plan (referenced by `plan_id` as a foreign key).
- Each session includes multiple exercises, ordered by the sequence in which they are completed.
- The **WorkoutSession** is a separate entity because each workout plan needs to contain multiple sessions.

---

### **Exercise**
- This is a source database where users can choose their exercises.
- Each exercise has a unique `exercise_id`.
- Multiple session exercises can be composed of different exercises from this database (e.g., compound exercises).
- The **Exercise** is a separate entity as it is independent of other entities.

---

### **SessionExercise**
- Each workout session can include multiple exercises selected from the **Exercise** database.
- The exercises within a session are stored as session exercises linked to specific workout sessions.
