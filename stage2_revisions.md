Because so much of Stage 2 was graded as simply "missing", and the parts that were missing were nearly entirely incorrect, we've essentially entirely replaced our Stage 2.

In the `doc` folder, the original file `Database Design` from Stage 2 has been renamed Stage2Orig_Database Design, as has `DocumentDiagram.pdf`. See `Stage 2 Database Design.md` and `ER Diagram.pdf`

The "old" Stage 2 release is included at the top level (`old-stage-2.tar`) for convinience of reference if you'd like, and the new version is simply the current version of the repository.
